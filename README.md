The goal of this project is to try to learn Go by writing small programs.

There are programs:
* [Display prime numbers](#display-prime-numbers)
* [Display square](#display-square)


# Display prime numbers
Display prime numbers up to N. 
```bash
go run display_prime_numbers.go
```

# Display square 
Generate a square of `#` of size NxN.
```bash
go run display_square.go
```
